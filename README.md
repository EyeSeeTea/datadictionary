```

### Dashboard tab configuration

For the dashboard tabs two sql views are required:
- sqlView: This sql view lists all the dashboards in the database. This information can be retrieved using the dhis2 API. The sql view id can be configured [here](index.html#L98)
```
<input id="sqlViewSettings" type="text" value="[INSERT_SQLVIEW_ID]"/>
```

- sqlViewEdit: This sql provides the user group id. The user group id is required for the Edit link in each row. This link will allow to edit a dashboard. The sql view id can be configured [here](index.html#L101)
```
<input id="sqlViewEditSettings" type="text" value="[INSERT_SQLVIEW_EDIT_ID]"/
```

This sql views have to be inserted in the DHIS2 server. Its ids will be shown in the preference menu.
