# Data Dictionary

Web Application (Dhis2 App) to visualize (1) a picture of the metadata in the database and its connection across programs, datasets, health facilities, and (2) how the data is being used and filled across the different countries and platforms. It has been developed using jQuery, D3 and html technologies.

DHIS2, a flexible, web-based open source information system to collect and analyze information, is being used by PSI as its HMIS. Data is feeding dayly from up to 15.000 sites across 60+ countries, allowing analysis of the health programs impact at district, country, and global level. 

## Sections

* Org Unit
* Datasets & Programs
* Dashboard
* Data Element Groups
* Indicator Groups

## Automatic Setup

Every time the app is started, it will:

* Check if the user role _DataDictionary admin_ exists, otherwise it will be created. By default, this role includes the authority _Admin Data Dictionary_. Users with that authority are considered admin and can change some settings of the app. Likewise, a user having the authority _ALL_ set is considered also to be an admin.

* Create the 2 SQL views required by the Dashboard tab. 

## Global settings

 * Organization Unit Level: Set the level for the organization unit. It defines the organization unit level for the Org Unit Tab.
 * Dashboard SQL View Id: Show the sqlViewSettings and sqlViewEditSettings Id for the dashboard tab. 
 
Only admins of the app can change those values.
 
## Table settings

The tables shown in the tabs DataSets & Programs, Data Elements Group and Indicator Groups are configurable. You may change which settings are used (user/organizational), and configure the columns clicking on the edit button nearby. You can change which columns are visible, their order, and the sorting criteria. Likewise, you can customize the rows in the popup table. Note that only admins can modify the organizational settings. 

## Configuration
Configure the DHIS url in [the manifest.webapp](manifest.webapp#L7) depending on your DHIS server instance:
```
"activities":{"dhis":{"href":"../dhis/"}}
```

### Dashboard tab configuration

For the dashboard tabs, those two sql views are created automatically:

- Dashboard List SQLView Id: This sql view lists all the dashboards in the database. This information can be retrieved using the dhis2 API. The sql view id can be configured [here](index.html#L98)
```
<input id="sqlViewSettings" type="text" value="[INSERT_SQLVIEW_ID]"/>
```

- Dashboard Join SQLView Id: This sql provides the user group id. The user group id is required for the Edit link in each row. This link will allow to edit a dashboard. The sql view id can be configured [here](index.html#L101)
```
<input id="sqlViewEditSettings" type="text" value="[INSERT_SQLVIEW_EDIT_ID]"/
```
